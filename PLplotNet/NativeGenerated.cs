In addition, C callback routines for the transformation can be supplied by the user such as the mypltr function in examples/c/x09c.c which provides a general linear transformation between index coordinates and world coordinates.For languages other than C you should consult  for the details concerning how PLTRANSFORM_callback arguments are interfaced. However, in general, a particular pattern of callback-associated arguments such as a tr vector with 6 elements; xg and yg vectors; or xg and yg matrices are respectively interfaced to a linear-transformation routine similar to the above mypltr function; pltr1; and pltr2. Furthermore, some of our more sophisticated bindings (see, e.g., ) support native language callbacks for handling index to world-coordinate transformations. Examples of these various approaches are given in examples/ltlanguagegtx09*, examples/ltlanguagegtx16*, examples/ltlanguagegtx20*, examples/ltlanguagegtx21*, and examples/ltlanguagegtx22*, for all our supported languages.</param>

The conversion specifications which are similar to those provided by system strftime routines are the following: %a: The abbreviated (English) weekday name. %A: The full (English) weekday name. %b: The abbreviated (English) month name. %B: The full (English) month name. %c: Equivalent to %a %b %d %T %Y (non-ISO). %C: The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer. %d: The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31). %D: Equivalent to %m/%d/%y (non-ISO). %e: Like %d, but a leading zero is replaced by a space. %F: Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format). %h: Equivalent to %b. %H: The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23). %I: The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12). %j: The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366). %k: The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.) %l: The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %I.) %m: The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12). %M: The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59). %n: A newline character. %p: Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value. Noon is treated as "PM" and midnight as "AM". %r: Equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p. %R: The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). For a version including the seconds, see %T below. %s: The number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC). %S: The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60). (The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.) %t: A tab character. %T: The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S). %u: The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1. See also %w. %U: The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W. %v: Equivalent to %e-%b-%Y. %V: The ISO 8601 week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at least 4 days in the new year. See also %U and %W. %w: The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0. See also %u. %W: The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of week 01. %x: Equivalent to %a %b %d %Y. %X: Equivalent to %T. %y: The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99). %Y: The year as a decimal number including a century. %z: The UTC time-zone string = "+0000". %Z: The UTC time-zone abbreviation = "UTC". %+: The UTC date and time in default format of the Unix date command which is equivalent to %a %b %d %T %Z %Y. %%: A literal "%" character.  The conversion specifications which are extensions to those normally provided by system strftime routines are the following: %(0-9): The fractional part of the seconds field (including leading decimal point) to the specified accuracy. Thus %S%3 would give seconds to millisecond accuracy (00.000). %.: The fractional part of the seconds field (including leading decimal point) to the maximum available accuracy. Thus %S%. would give seconds with fractional part up to 9 decimal places if available.</param>
